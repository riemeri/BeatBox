# BeatBox
This is a basic Android application which lists a collection of sounds in a grid, and allows you to play the sounds simply by tapping them. Multiples sounds can be played simultaneously (so you can make an audible mess), and there is a slider at the bottom to set the playback speed before starting a sound. 

### Note
This app was developed for a class assignment, and the idea and sounds come from the Big Nerd Ranch programming book.
